### Project Title
**Breast Cancer Predictor**

### Project Description
The Breast Cancer Predictor is a machine learning project developed to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer by analyzing clinical features of breast tissue. This application uses a dataset of breast cancer cases to train a classification model that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on input features. The project utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web app, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions instantly.

### Features
- Predictive modeling using a machine learning classification algorithm.
- Interactive web app built with Streamlit for easy use and accessibility.
- Detailed data preprocessing and exploration steps to ensure model accuracy.
- Model evaluation with performance metrics visualized using Python libraries.

### Repository Structure
- `/app`: Contains the Streamlit application script for running the web app.
- `/assets`: Includes assets like images or CSS files used by the Streamlit app.
- `/data`: Stores the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `/model`: Contains the trained machine learning models and any scripts related to model training and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python libraries needed to run the project.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage details.
